ELECTRO-VOICE

Electro-Voice is an effective solution to bridge the communication gap for deaf-mute-blind individuals, particularly in scenarios where visual methods like sign language or lip reading are impractical, or when the communication recipient is unfamiliar with sign language or has visual impairments, to enable seamless interaction and understanding


A device to be used by people with hearing, speaking and blind disability, so that they can have a two-way communication, has been proposed in this project. There are two main features that thedevicecando, the first one being able to convert the speech into vibrotactile output, and the other feature is being ableto get the input as a Morse using 2 identical touch sensors and then converting it into speech.
